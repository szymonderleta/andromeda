Andromeda is a microservices-based platform serving as local single-player, browser-accessible game service. The system is built using a Raspberry Pi 5 computer (8GB RAM model) with installed Debian 12 operating system. Therefore, it is based on the arm architecture. The applications were developed in several programming languages including:

Java, using the Spring and Hibernate libraries or only JDBC driver

JavaScript, using the REACT library

Python, using the Django library

Andromeda is an open-source project based on the Apache 2.0 license

The system is composed of the following services-components:

Relational MySQL Database (Community Version) (please specify whether it is MariaDb)

Apache Tomcat 10 server for managing microservices written in Java (mainly version 21)

Apache HTTP Server providing a set of subpages for the end user

Each application and microservice has its dedicated directory containing source code, description of abilities, functions, database schema and means of communication.# Empty
